# Contributing

Welcome, and thanks for lending a hand! Before we get started, please read the
[Couchbase Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Discussion

We'd love for you to join us on the [Couchbase Forum](https://forums.couchbase.com).
For more interactive discussions we have `#ruby` channel on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sQ5qbPZuTh).

## Reporting Issues

The simplest way to help is to report bugs or request new features.

We use Jira for issue tracking: [https://issues.couchbase.com/projects/RCBC/](https://issues.couchbase.com/projects/RCBC/)

To create an issue, or comment on an existing issue, you'll need to sign up
for an account. It's quick and painless (or if it's not, click on the
"Report a problem" link on the signup page or get in touch via the forum).

## Pull Requests

We use Github for code review. But to allow us to integrate your changes, you need to register for a Gerrit account and
sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

> We acknowledge Gerrit can be intimidating for new users.
> We're considering alternates that will make it easier for GitHub
> natives to contribute.

  1. Visit [https://review.couchbase.org](https://review.couchbase.org) and register for an account.
  2. Review our [Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA)](https://review.couchbase.org/static/individual_agreement.html).
  3. Agree to the CLA by visiting [https://review.couchbase.org/settings/#Agreements](https://review.couchbase.org/settings/#Agreements)
     Otherwise, we won't be able to merge your changes.
