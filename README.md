This repository contains the third generation of the official Couchbase SDK for Ruby (aka. SDKv3)

## Support and Feedback

If you find an issue, please file it in [our JIRA issue tracker](https://couchbase.com/issues/browse/RCBC). Also you are
always welcome on [our forum](https://forums.couchbase.com/c/ruby-sdk) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sQ5qbPZuTh).

Please attach version information to ticket/post. To obtain this information use the following command:

    $ ruby -r couchbase -e 'p Couchbase::VERSION'

## Installation

The library tested with the MRI 2.6, 2.7 and 3.0. Supported platforms are Linux and MacOS.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "couchbase", "3.3.0"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install couchbase

For some platforms we precompile binary packages. When, for some reason, binary package cannot be used, pass
`--platform=ruby` to `gem install` command (or check `specific_platform` and `force_ruby_platform` options of Bundler).
In latter case, see [Development](#development) section for build dependencies.

## Usage

Here is a basic steps demonstrating basic operations with data:

```ruby
require "couchbase"
include Couchbase # include Couchbase module for brevity

# initialize library
cluster = Cluster.connect("couchbase://127.0.0.1", "Administrator", "password")

# open bucket and collection for data operations
bucket = cluster.bucket("my_bucket")
collection = bucket.default_collection

# update or insert the document
res = collection.upsert("foo", {"bar" => 42})
res.cas
#=> 22120998714646

# retrieve document from the collection
res = collection.get("foo")
res.cas
#=> 22120998714646
res.content
#=> {"bar"=>42}

# remove document
res = collection.remove("foo")
res.cas
#=> 47891154812182

# fetch top-3 cities by number of hotels in the collection
res = cluster.query("
          SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM `travel-sample`
          WHERE type = $type
          GROUP BY city
          ORDER BY cnt DESC
          LIMIT 3",
        Options::Query(named_parameters: {type: "hotel"}, metrics: true))
res.rows.each do |row|
  p row
end
#=> {"city"=>"San Francisco", "cnt"=>132}
#   {"city"=>"London", "cnt"=>67}
#   {"city"=>"Paris", "cnt"=>64}
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

Part of the library is written in C++, and requires both C and C++ compilers installed on the system. To configure build
environment, it uses `cmake`. When these tools installed, the build process is easy:

    $ rake compile

## Generate Documentation

To generate documentation `yard` library is highly recommended.

    $ gem install yard

The following steps will generate API reference for selected git tag:

    $ rake doc

Now the API reference is accessible using web browser (where `VERSION` is current version of the SDK)

    $ firefox doc/couchbase-ruby-client-VERSION/index.html
