This repository contains the third generation of the official Couchbase SDK for Ruby (aka. SDKv3)

## Support and Feedback

If you find an issue, please file it in [our JIRA issue tracker](https://couchbase.com/issues/browse/RCBC). Also you are
always welcome on [our forum](https://forums.couchbase.com/c/ruby-sdk) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sQ5qbPZuTh).

Please attach version information to the ticket/post. To obtain this information, use the following command:

    $ ruby -r couchbase -e 'p Couchbase::VERSION'

## Installation

The library has been tested with MRI 2.7, 3.0 and 3.1. Supported platforms are Linux and MacOS.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "couchbase", "3.4.0"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install couchbase

For some platforms we precompile binary packages. When, for some reason, binary packages cannot be used, pass
`--platform=ruby` to the `gem install` command (or check the `specific_platform` and `force_ruby_platform` options of Bundler).
In latter case, see the [Development](#development) section for build dependencies.

## Usage

Here are some basic steps demonstrating basic operations with data:

```ruby
require "couchbase"
include Couchbase # include Couchbase module for brevity

# initialize library
cluster = Cluster.connect("couchbase://127.0.0.1", "Administrator", "password")

# open bucket and collection for data operations
bucket = cluster.bucket("my_bucket")
collection = bucket.default_collection

# update or insert the document
res = collection.upsert("foo", {"bar" => 42})
res.cas
#=> 22120998714646

# retrieve document from the collection
res = collection.get("foo")
res.cas
#=> 22120998714646
res.content
#=> {"bar"=>42}

# remove document
res = collection.remove("foo")
res.cas
#=> 47891154812182

# fetch top-3 cities by number of hotels in the collection
res = cluster.query("
          SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM `travel-sample`
          WHERE type = $type
          GROUP BY city
          ORDER BY cnt DESC
          LIMIT 3",
        Options::Query(named_parameters: {type: "hotel"}, metrics: true))
res.rows.each do |row|
  p row
end
#=> {"city"=>"San Francisco", "cnt"=>132}
#   {"city"=>"London", "cnt"=>67}
#   {"city"=>"Paris", "cnt"=>64}
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

### Compiling

Part of the library is written in C++, and requires both C and C++ compilers installed on the system. To configure the build
environment it uses `cmake`. When these tools are installed, the build process is easy:

    $ bundle exec rake compile

### Testing

By default, a mock cluster is used for testing. If you wish to use a real cluster, you can define the
`TEST_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable (e.g. `TEST_CONNECTION_STRING=couchbase://localhost`). You might also need to set the values for the `TEST_USERNAME`, `TEST_PASSWORD`, and `TEST_BUCKET`
 environment variables.

To run the tests:

    $ bundle exec rake test

### Linting

We use the [RuboCop linter](https://rubocop.org/). To run it:

    $ bundle exec rubocop

### Packaging

To build and install the Ruby gem (where `VERSION` is the current version of the SDK):

    $ gem build couchbase.gemspec
    $ gem install couchbase-VERSION.snapshot.gem

## Generate Documentation

To generate documentation `yard` library is highly recommended.

    $ gem install yard

The following steps will generate API reference for selected git tag:

    $ rake doc

Now the API reference is accessible using a web browser (where `VERSION` is the current version of the SDK)

    $ firefox doc/couchbase-ruby-client-VERSION/index.html
